Project Prompt: Mechanic Shop Management Web Application

Goal:
Build a full-stack web application for a mechanic shop to manage customer information, vehicle details, repair history, and payments. The system should allow easy data entry, viewing, and secure storage, and be runnable locally on a computer.

Core Features

User Registration & Identification

Register new customers using:

Phone number (unique identifier)

Car plate number (linked to the customer)

Each customer can have multiple vehicles.

Include basic customer info: name, contact, address, and notes.

Repair & Service History

Record every visit:

Date of service

Work performed / repairs done

Parts replaced

Labor cost, parts cost, and total

Mechanic name (optional)

View full service history for each customer or vehicle.

Data Viewing Interface

Search bar to quickly find customers by phone, name, or car plate.

Dashboard view showing recent visits, pending work, or top customers.

Sortable and filterable tables for easy browsing.

Data Entry Interface

Easy-to-use form for adding:

New customers

New vehicles

New repair/service records

Edit or delete existing entries with confirmation.

Authentication & Security

Secure login and logout system (username/password).

Only authenticated users can access data entry or modification features.

Hash and store passwords securely (e.g., bcrypt).

Role-based access (e.g., admin, mechanic, viewer).

Database & Storage

All data should be stored in a local database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL).

Structured database schema:

users (for login credentials)

customers

vehicles

services

Ensure data integrity and relationships (e.g., one-to-many between customers and vehicles).

Local Setup

Should be downloadable and runnable locally on Windows/Mac/Linux.

Include clear setup instructions (e.g., README.md) with:

How to install dependencies

How to initialize the database

How to start the local server

Optional but Recommended Enhancements

Export feature: Download service history as CSV or PDF.

Backup feature: Export or import the entire database.

Responsive design: Accessible from desktop, tablet, or phone.

Light/dark mode for ease of use in a workshop environment.

Notifications/reminders: Option to mark upcoming maintenance or follow-up dates.
